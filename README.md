codeWizard
==========

Another command line program, this time designed to help you get started on your projects faster and more efficiently! 
**Code Wizard** uses data that you provide in a specially formatted text file (a sample is generated by the program, if needed) 
to create a comprehensive skeleton of a class. Simple, eh?

Currently, **Code Wizard** isn't very powerful but I plan on developing it further. Feel free to fork this repo!

Planned additions:

*   Support for more languages
*   More comprehensive code generation
*   Ability to create documentation for the generated code
